# TOWERS OF HANOI React 1.0.0 

![image](https://github.com/NeuralCortex/Towers_Of_Hanoi_React/blob/main/app.png)

## How the program works

Towers of Hanoi is a divide and conquer mathematical puzzle game.<br>
The game consists of 3 stacks, with discs of different sizes ordered by size.<br>
The aim of the game is to rearrange the discs from stack 1 to stack 3 (i.e. the stack on the right).<br>
Only the existing stacks may be used and no larger disc may lie on top of a smaller one.

The program uses a recursive algorithm to solve the problem.<br>
On the right side of the program there is a table with all the necessary steps to solve the problem.<br>
This solution can be exported to a CSV file.

A maximum of 10 discs are supported (1024 steps to solve).

## How the web app works

To use the app, you need to execute following steps:
1. Install Node.js
2. Go to the project's main directory.
3. Type `npm install` - Wait for Completion
4. Type `npm start` for Development-Mode or
5. Or type `npm run build` for Production-Mode

## Technology used

This web app was created with Create React App.

The following tools were used:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
